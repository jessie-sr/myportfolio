						In our rapidly advancing digital world, there's a poignant and growing disconnect that often goes unnoticed: the struggle of the elderly to keep pace with the smart revolution. It's a story of a generation, once at the forefront of society, now finding itself grappling with a world where technology seems to speak a different language.
					</div>
					<div className="paragraph">
						Imagine the mix of frustration and isolation our grandparents might feel, wrestling with apps and websites that seem to be designed for someone half their age. Something as simple as booking a ride, paying a bill online, or just keeping in touch with family turns into a maze of swipes and taps that feels more like a puzzle than a tool. It's not just about feeling out of touch; it's the sting of feeling left behind in the relentless march of progress.
					</div>
					<div className="paragraph">
						In an attempt to bridge this digital divide, some tech giants have started rolling out 'senior-friendly' versions of their popular apps. DiDi, Alipay, Baidu, and others have introduced features like larger fonts and simplified interfaces, aiming to make their platforms more accessible to older users. But these efforts, while well-intentioned, often fall short of truly bridging the gap. The changes are usually minimal, addressing the surface-level symptoms of the problem rather than its root - the fundamental design philosophy that overlooks the elderly.
					</div>
					<div className="paragraph">
						This is especially poignant in places like China, where there's a government push for more elder-accessible digital platforms. But despite these calls to action, the transformation within the digital landscape has been slow and, in many ways, superficial. The modifications, more often than not, remain confined to the home pages, leaving the more intricate functionalities untouched and just as perplexing for the elderly user.
					</div>
					<div className="paragraph">
						Behind these lukewarm efforts lies a deeper issue: the untapped potential of the 'silver economy.' There's a whole market segment represented by older adults, rich with experience and wisdom, yet it remains largely overlooked by the tech world. The reluctance of tech giants to dive into this market is driven by economic calculationsâ€”older users are perceived as less engaged and less profitable, especially when restrictions on advertising in elderly-specific apps are considered.
					</div>
					<div className="paragraph">
						But this challenge goes beyond economics; it's about empathy, respect, and inclusivity. Imagine the sense of belonging and empowerment our elders would feel if they could effortlessly use technology to connect with their communities, access information, and enjoy the conveniences of the digital age. We need to look at technology not just as a tool for efficiency but as a means of inclusion that can enrich the lives of all, regardless of age.
					</div>
					<div className="paragraph">
						The real game-changer will be a shift in mindset on how we design technology for the elderly. It's about diving deeper, understanding how they interact with and perceive technology, and designing with a heart. This isn't merely about user-friendly interfaces; it's about creating a digital environment where the elderly feel acknowledged, respected, and valued.
					</div>
					<div className="paragraph">
						As we navigate the ever-evolving digital landscape, we face a pivotal question: How do we ensure technology, meant to connect us, doesn't end up sidelining a vital part of our community? The interaction between technology and the elderly is more than a design challenge; it's a reflection of our societal values. Our response to the needs of our older generation today will set the tone for how future generations remember us.

						"Where is Building XX?" I've heard the question so often, and yet, though I have lived on Ziteng Street for nearly two decades, my invariable response was a smile that was really just a question mark itself.
					</div>
					<div className="paragraph">
						I'm sure this is a familiar script for most of us: so caught up in our whirlwind lives, the people next door remain just faces we pass by. But then, COVID-19 burst onto the scene, and I found myself, as a community volunteer, diving headfirst into the frontline response. Who knew that simply knowing your way around a bunch of buildings could be your ticket to becoming the neighborhood's unsung hero?					</div>
					<div className="paragraph">
						Managing the maze of Minhang District Ziteng Street Neighborhood, with its 20+ buildings, became a game of strategic navigation. It wasn't merely a case of avoiding the proverbial bullet; it was a question of getting heart medication to Mrs. Wang and a week's stash of groceries to Mr. Zhang. Having to do all this in Shanghai's summer heat, in what felt like a walking sauna thanks to the protective gear, added to my daily fitness regime something of a tweak. The need to juggle tasks in pandemic mode-from mundane to mind-boggling-turned us all into jacks-of-all-trades. One minute I'm a permit officer, the next some sort of makeshift dog whisperer for quarantined pooches. Whoever said community work isn't diverse?					</div>
					<div className="paragraph">
						The payoff, though, was in the small moments - those genuine 'thank you's from the residents that made all the sweat worth it. Through all this, I watched my perception of community work evolve from some vague notion into something palpably real. Every door knocked, every parcel delivered, shortened the emotional distance between us. This pandemic, paradoxically, ironically, thrust us to our breaking points and yet pulled us together, knitting a closer, more compassionate community fabric.					</div>

						Embarking on the "Jack O Translate" project marked a significant leap in my journey as a prospective software engineer. This wasn't just another run-of-the-mill app; it was my foray into independent webapp development, challenging me to come up with innovative software design and apply my programming skills in a real-world context.
					</div>
					<div className="paragraph">
						"Jack O Translate" is a web application that supports translations between multiple languages. What makes it stand out is its ability to customize tone and context in translations, a feature often missing in standard translation tools but achieved here through integration with the OpenAI API. The technical backbone of the project consisted of Ruby on Rails for the backend, HTML and Bootstrap for the frontend, and JavaScript and CSS for interactive and aesthetic elements. User authentication was managed using the Devise gem, with Google OAuth2 for Single Sign-On, and PostgreSQL as the database. 
					</div>
					<div className="paragraph">
						The complexity of this project stemmed from various factors. Firstly, as a self-initiated venture, it lacked the predefined structure and guidance of a course assignment. I was in the driver's seat, responsible for conceptualizing, designing, and architecting the entire application. Secondly, working independently meant limited access to in-person support, compelling me to navigate and resolve intricate challenges such as software version incompatibilities, predominantly on my own. Transitioning from the Codio platform, used in my coursework, to Visual Studio Code for this project added another layer of intricacy. Moreover, the integration of the OpenAI API using Ruby, a process not documented in the official OpenAI guide, necessitating a novel approach. Deploying the application to Heroku also introduced complexities not covered in my coursework, demanding considerations for the production environment such as authentication and external databases.
					</div>
					<div className="paragraph">
						Confronting these challenges head-on, I employed a series of multifaceted approaches. The absence of a guiding structure led me to meticulously research and design the applicationâ€™s functionality and UI, drawing inspiration from online resources and past project templates, and finally adopting the agile methodology, which characterized by iterative development, Behavior-Driven Development (BDD), and Test-Driven Development (TDD). For software compatibility issues, I leveraged online forums like stack overflow and developer communities on platforms including github and reddit to find solutions. For a smooth transition from Codio to Visual Studio Code, I familiarized myself with Visual Studio Code's features, extensions, and shortcuts through online tutorials and practice. Customizing the IDE to suit the project's needs, I set up an efficient workflow that enhanced productivity and streamlined the development process. To integrate the OpenAI API into my Rails app, I explored several third-party gems, evaluating their compatibility and ultimately integrating the â€˜openaiâ€™ gem. This process involved extensive experimentation with API calls to ensure seamless integration, as well as managing API keys using environment variables and configuration files excluded from version control to ensure security.
					</div>
					<div className="paragraph">
						The most daunting challenge during this developing process emerged while adding the email confirmation feature using the Devise gem, where I encountered an internal server error (code 500) in the production environment on Heroku. This issue was particularly perplexing as it did not present itself in the local development environment, thereby obscuring detailed error messages and necessitating a thorough investigation of all potential error sources. My approach began with verifying routing and configurations, followed by enhancing RSpec tests. When these steps did not yield a solution, I sought advice from online forums and eventually, my TA and professor. The breakthrough came from the head TA of my Introduction to Software Engineering course, who had previously navigated a similar challenge. He suggested transitioning the email platform from Gmail SMTP to SendGrid SMTP, a move that effectively addressed the compatibility issues with my development tools.
					</div>
					<div className="paragraph">
						"Jack O Translate" was more than a technical project; it was a testament to my self-reliance and innovative spirit. It pushed me to stretch my knowledge and skills, overcoming complex technical and strategic challenges. This experience has not only deepened my understanding of software engineering principles but also encouraged me to engage more with the software engineering community. As I aim for the M.S.-SE program at CMU (fingers crossed for that acceptance!), I'm excited to bring this wealth of experience, a passion for continuous learning, and a drive for innovation to the community.
