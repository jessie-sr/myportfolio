						In our rapidly advancing digital world, there's a poignant and growing disconnect that often goes unnoticed: the struggle of the elderly to keep pace with the smart revolution. It's a story of a generation, once at the forefront of society, now finding itself grappling with a world where technology seems to speak a different language.
					</div>
					<div className="paragraph">
						Imagine the mix of frustration and isolation our grandparents might feel, wrestling with apps and websites that seem to be designed for someone half their age. Something as simple as booking a ride, paying a bill online, or just keeping in touch with family turns into a maze of swipes and taps that feels more like a puzzle than a tool. It's not just about feeling out of touch; it's the sting of feeling left behind in the relentless march of progress.
					</div>
					<div className="paragraph">
						In an attempt to bridge this digital divide, some tech giants have started rolling out 'senior-friendly' versions of their popular apps. DiDi, Alipay, Baidu, and others have introduced features like larger fonts and simplified interfaces, aiming to make their platforms more accessible to older users. But these efforts, while well-intentioned, often fall short of truly bridging the gap. The changes are usually minimal, addressing the surface-level symptoms of the problem rather than its root - the fundamental design philosophy that overlooks the elderly.
					</div>
					<div className="paragraph">
						This is especially poignant in places like China, where there's a government push for more elder-accessible digital platforms. But despite these calls to action, the transformation within the digital landscape has been slow and, in many ways, superficial. The modifications, more often than not, remain confined to the home pages, leaving the more intricate functionalities untouched and just as perplexing for the elderly user.
					</div>
					<div className="paragraph">
						Behind these lukewarm efforts lies a deeper issue: the untapped potential of the 'silver economy.' There's a whole market segment represented by older adults, rich with experience and wisdom, yet it remains largely overlooked by the tech world. The reluctance of tech giants to dive into this market is driven by economic calculations—older users are perceived as less engaged and less profitable, especially when restrictions on advertising in elderly-specific apps are considered.
					</div>
					<div className="paragraph">
						But this challenge goes beyond economics; it's about empathy, respect, and inclusivity. Imagine the sense of belonging and empowerment our elders would feel if they could effortlessly use technology to connect with their communities, access information, and enjoy the conveniences of the digital age. We need to look at technology not just as a tool for efficiency but as a means of inclusion that can enrich the lives of all, regardless of age.
					</div>
					<div className="paragraph">
						The real game-changer will be a shift in mindset on how we design technology for the elderly. It's about diving deeper, understanding how they interact with and perceive technology, and designing with a heart. This isn't merely about user-friendly interfaces; it's about creating a digital environment where the elderly feel acknowledged, respected, and valued.
					</div>
					<div className="paragraph">
						As we navigate the ever-evolving digital landscape, we face a pivotal question: How do we ensure technology, meant to connect us, doesn't end up sidelining a vital part of our community? The interaction between technology and the elderly is more than a design challenge; it's a reflection of our societal values. Our response to the needs of our older generation today will set the tone for how future generations remember us.

						"Where is Building XX?" I've heard the question so often, and yet, though I have lived on Ziteng Street for nearly two decades, my invariable response was a smile that was really just a question mark itself.
					</div>
					<div className="paragraph">
						I'm sure this is a familiar script for most of us: so caught up in our whirlwind lives, the people next door remain just faces we pass by. But then, COVID-19 burst onto the scene, and I found myself, as a community volunteer, diving headfirst into the frontline response. Who knew that simply knowing your way around a bunch of buildings could be your ticket to becoming the neighborhood's unsung hero?					</div>
					<div className="paragraph">
						Managing the maze of Minhang District Ziteng Street Neighborhood, with its 20+ buildings, became a game of strategic navigation. It wasn't merely a case of avoiding the proverbial bullet; it was a question of getting heart medication to Mrs. Wang and a week's stash of groceries to Mr. Zhang. Having to do all this in Shanghai's summer heat, in what felt like a walking sauna thanks to the protective gear, added to my daily fitness regime something of a tweak. The need to juggle tasks in pandemic mode-from mundane to mind-boggling-turned us all into jacks-of-all-trades. One minute I'm a permit officer, the next some sort of makeshift dog whisperer for quarantined pooches. Whoever said community work isn't diverse?					</div>
					<div className="paragraph">
						The payoff, though, was in the small moments - those genuine 'thank you's from the residents that made all the sweat worth it. Through all this, I watched my perception of community work evolve from some vague notion into something palpably real. Every door knocked, every parcel delivered, shortened the emotional distance between us. This pandemic, paradoxically, ironically, thrust us to our breaking points and yet pulled us together, knitting a closer, more compassionate community fabric.					</div>

						It all began with a simple frustration. 
					</div>
					<div className="paragraph">
						While texting my international friends and emailing professors, I realized that most translation apps fell short—they provided literal translations but missed the subtle nuances that different contexts demanded. I found myself wishing for a tool that could adapt its tone and context, making the translations more accurate and meaningful. This small, nagging thought eventually snowballed into something bigger: the inspiration for "Jack O Translate”.
					</div>
					<div className="paragraph">
						Creating "Jack O Translate" wasn’t just about building another translation app. It was my first true dive into independent web development, where I had to apply every bit of programming knowledge I’d gathered and then some. I wanted this app to stand out, to do more than just convert words from one language to another. By integrating the OpenAI API, I aimed to provide users with a translation experience that could adjust its tone to capture what one wanted to say.
					</div>
					<div className="paragraph">
						I used Ruby on Rails for the backend, complemented with HTML and Bootstrap up front; sprinkled a little JavaScript and CSS on top to give it all those interactive touches. It was quite a challenge. This was not a school assignment, but my project-my responsibility; hence, there was no predefined structure, no professor's hand guiding me. I had to conceptualize, design, and architect the whole thing from scratch.
					</div>
					<div className="paragraph">
						Deploying the app to Heroku brought its own set of hurdles, especially when I hit an internal server error while adding email confirmation via the Devise gem. Everything worked fine locally, but once live on Heroku, the dreaded 500 error appeared, and the usual debugging tools offered no help. After hours of combing through online forums, tweaking configurations, and enhancing RSpec tests, I finally found a solution. With advice from my TA, I switched from Gmail SMTP to SendGrid SMTP, resolving the issue and pushing the project forward.					</div>
					<div className="paragraph">
						"Jack O Translate" turned out to be more than just a technical challenge. It was a journey of persistence, innovation, and self-reliance. I had to navigate uncharted waters, solve problems on the fly, and stretch my capabilities beyond what I thought was possible. The experience not only deepened my understanding of software engineering but also solidified my passion for it.					</div>
					<div className="paragraph">
						As I move forward in my journey as a prospecting software engineer, I carry with me the lessons learned from this project—lessons in creativity, problem-solving, and the sheer joy of turning a small idea into something tangible and impactful. "Jack O Translate" started as a solution to a personal frustration, but it grew into a testament to what can be achieved when you push beyond your comfort zone and embrace the challenges that come your way.
