I love designing and building things, and I found creating sophisticated software systems intrisically fun.

		description:
			"Starting off as an accounting student, my career goal took a sharp turn during the COVID-19 pandemic. Witnessing the challenges that the elderly faced with complicated health systems and pervasive misinformation, as well as the scarcity of thoughtful technology catered to their needs, I was fueled to move into software engineering, creating intelligent systems specially for the elderly to enhance their overall quality of life. Blending my analytical background with a newfound passion for technology, I am now committed to creating digital solutions accessible and impactful for our aging society.",
